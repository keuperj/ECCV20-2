abstract="In this paper, we view multiple object tracking as a graph partitioning problem. Given any object detector, we build the graph of all detections and aim to partition it into trajectories. To quantify the similarity of any two detections, we consider local cues such as point tracks and speed, global cues such as appearance, as well as intermediate ones such as trajectory straightness. These different clues are dealt jointly to make the approach robust to detection mistakes (missing or extra detections). We thus define a Conditional Random Field and optimize it using an efficient combination of message passing and move-making algorithms. Our approach is fast on video batch sizes of hundreds of frames. Competitive and stable results on varied videos demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.",

We propose a novel energy formulation which incorporates both segmentation and motion estimation in a single framework. Our energy functions enforce motion coherence both within and across frames.

In addition, we introduce a new ground-truth dataset, called Georgia Tech Segmentation and Tracking Dataset (GT-SegTrack), for the evaluation of segmentation accuracy in video tracking.

The maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) data association problem is mapped into a cost-flow network with a non-overlap constraint on trajectories. The optimal data association is found by a min-cost flow algorithm in the network. The network is augmented to include an explicit occlusion model(EOM) to track with long-term inter-object occlusions. A solution to the EOM-based network is found by an iterative approach built upon the original algorithm. Initialization and termination of trajectories and potential false observations are modeled by the formulation intrinsically. The method is efficient and does not require hypotheses pruning. Performance is compared with previous results on two public pedestrian datasets to show its improvement.},

Although tracklet-association methods have shown impressive results in several challenging datasets, discriminability of the appearance model remains a limitation. Inspired by the work of person identity recognition, we obtain discriminative appearance-based affinity models by a novel framework to incorporate the merits of person identity recognition, which help multi-person tracking performance. During off-line learning, a small set of local image descriptors is selected to be used in on-line learned appearances-based affinity models effectively and efficiently. Given short but reliable track-lets generated by frame-to-frame association of detection responses, we identify them as query tracklets and gallery tracklets. For each gallery tracklet, a target-specific appearance model is learned from the on-line training samples collected by spatio-temporal constraints. Both gallery tracklets and query tracklets 
are fed into hierarchical association framework to obtain final tracking results. We evaluate our proposed system on several public datasets and show significant improvements in terms of tracking evaluation metrics.},

To solve practical instances of the DAP we propose an algorithm that uses an iterated K-scan sliding window technique. In each iteration we solve the linear programming relaxation of an integer program and next apply a greedy rounding procedure. Computational experiments indicate that the quality of the solutions found is quite satisfactory.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in organizing systematic evaluations to compare the various techniques. Unfortunately, the lack of common metrics for measuring the performance of multiple object trackers still makes it hard to compare their results. In this work, we introduce two intuitive and general metrics to allow for objective comparison of tracker characteristics, focusing on their precision in estimating object locations, their accuracy in recognizing object configurations and their ability to consistently label objects over time. These metrics have been extensively used in two large-scale international evaluations, the 2006 and 2007 CLEAR evaluations, to measure and compare the performance of multiple object trackers for a wide variety of tracking tasks. Selected performance results are 
presented and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented metrics are discussed based on the experience gained during the evaluations.},
